# My Crops Feature Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive My Crops feature for the Sahayak AI app following BLoC architecture pattern and Material Design 3 principles. The implementation includes financial dashboard integration, detailed crop management, and voice-first interactions.

## 🔧 Quick Actions Overflow Fix
✅ **Fixed the pixel overflow issue in the Quick Actions section** by updating the `QuickActionButton` widget:
- Reduced padding from `all(16)` to `symmetric(horizontal: 8, vertical: 12)`
- Decreased icon size from 24 to 22
- Added `Flexible` wrapper for text with `maxLines: 2` and `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis`
- Reduced spacing between icon and text from 8 to 6

## 🏗️ Architecture Implementation

### 📁 BLoC Pattern Structure
Created a scalable, production-ready architecture following the established pattern:
